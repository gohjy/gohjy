# Hi, I'm gohjy!
Hi, I'm gohjy, aka 11gohjy! I do simple HTML/CSS/JS coding and the occasional bit of Python. 
I enjoy collaborating with friends and do quite a few [projects related to my school](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Agohjy%20topic%3Anus-high&type=repositories) as well.

Here are some of my projects:
- [Directed](https://gohjy.github.io/directed/home), a simple redirect service that prevents [URL-change phishing attacks](https://www.iamstobbs.com/insights/you-spelled-it-wrong-exploring-typo-domains).
- [nushbus (NUSH Bus Timings)](https://gohjy.github.io/nushbus), which provides a simple way for NUSH students to check the arrival timings of buses around the school.
- My [NUSH GPA Calculator](https://gohjy.github.io/nush-gpa-calc), based on @nushhw's simpler one, calculates the grade point average of a student, pulling data from...
- [nush-pos-data](https://github.com/gohjy/nush-pos-data), which is a JSON-format dataset of Programme of Studies information generated using the [nushPOSextractor](https://github.com/Walnit/nushPOSextrator) tool.
- [base-css](https://github.com/gohjy/base-css) is a set of CSS styles that I find useful, intended as a "reset stylesheet".

And here are some things I like and/or have found useful:
- [zero-md](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md), a Markdown renderer for web pages, which is also the basis for the [zero-md-docs](https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md-docs) documentation website "generator"
- [mrt-badges](https://github.com/joulev/mrt-badges), a small service rendering the station code badges of MRT stations
- [hexauth](https://hexauth.coding398.dev/), a simple third-party login integration service

And here's a [link](https://www.stopkosa.com/) (or [two](https://www.makedmssafe.com/) or [three](https://www.stoponlineidchecks.org/)) to initiatives that you might want to take a look at.
