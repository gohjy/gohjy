# Hi, I'm gohjy!
Hi, I'm gohjy, aka 11gohjy! I do simple HTML/CSS/JS coding and the occasional bit of Python. 
I enjoy collaborating with friends and do quite a few [projects related to my school](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Agohjy+topic%3Anus-high+is%3Apublic&type=repositories) as well.

Here are some things I like and/or have found useful:
- [zero-md](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md), a Markdown renderer for web pages, which is also the basis for the [zero-md-docs](https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md-docs) documentation website "generator"
- [mrt-badges](https://github.com/joulev/mrt-badges), a small service rendering the station code badges of MRT stations
- [hexauth](https://hexauth.coding398.dev/), a simple third-party login integration service

And here's a [link](https://www.stopkosa.com/) (or [two](https://www.makedmssafe.com/) or [three](https://www.stoponlineidchecks.org/)) to initiatives that you might want to take a look at.
